-include prelim results from testbed

The testbed provides the ability to validate performance in real wireless channel environments. However, relying solely on testbed results complicates the task of examining the network's behaviour and diagnosing the root causes of performance degradations. For this purpose, while simulators lack the realism of testbeds, we leverage their ability to provide repeatability and full control over the parameter space. Furthermore, unlike a testbed setup, which is by necessity confined both in time and in space, a simulation can be made arbitrary complex (introduce interference**. Although simulators cannot be expected to fully mimic the behaviour of real wireless channels, they are effective in discovering the root causes underlying the performance degradations caused from implementation-specific design choices \cite{beyondInteroperability}.
